This machine learning model will predict earthquake and then it's magnitude.
Firstly it will predict earthquake and give output in the form of 0 (Earthquake will not occur) and 1 (Earthquake will occur).
If Earthquake will occur(if we get 1 in earthquake's prediction) , then it will predict it's magnitude .
